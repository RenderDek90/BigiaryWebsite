# BigiaryWebsite
This is my simple project to know how to use PHP and connecting it to HTML. 

Basically Bigiary stands for Biography Diary, meaning like u could post only text to the website, and it will connect to a database, which I am using Phpmyadmin. What makes it interesting, is that the post have validation function to get posted. Also, in the Index.php it contains the time when we post it, and get everything from the Form.html

That pretty much it actually. But, I'am greatfull to have this working. Because, it's the start where I know the basic use of Backend.
